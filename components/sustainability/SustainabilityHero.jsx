              The term farm-to-table suggests that the food served by a
              restaurant comes directly from a farm, without going through a
              store, market, or distributor. In its most pure form, a
              farm-to-table restaurant would imply that you eat at the farm.
              More frequently, farm-to-table means a direct relationship between
              a farm and a restaurant, which is what we have here at PureFoods.
              Rather than buying through a distributor or a food service, we
              have created relationships with local farms and purchase our food
              supply directly from them. From this process, our communityâ€™s
              local farmers benefit as they can now make more money, and you
              benefit, as you get to know the processes behind the creation,
              treatment, and preparation of your food. Moreover, at PureFoods,
              we have higher quality and fresher food because our items are
              delivered directly from our supplying farms, only hours after
              being harvested. As a result, we have the unique ability to have
              specialty items that may be difficult to get from a food
              distributor.
